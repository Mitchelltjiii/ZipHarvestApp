The ZipHarvest App - For recording and reporting data for compliance.

This React web app is designed to be used by farmers who are required by law to record and report the weight of their crops. It utilizes voice commands so that users can record data hands-free, allowing them to continue placing the crops on a scale so they can take measurements one-by-one, thus avoiding the need for them to stop and write down the info or have a second individual standing by to record the weights. 

This app is designed to work with the specific syntax requirements for reporting data, which adds to the overall usefulness compared to collecting data by hand. Once the data is collected, the process of reporting that info for compliance is much faster and simpler.

ZipHarvest avoids some of the major downfalls of similar systems. For example, there is no additional hardware required, whereas other solutions require a scale with bluetooth capability. This is a huge initial cost, and it limits the scalability for the customer.

Installation: ZipHarvest was live at www.ZipHarvest.app but is not longer operating. Subscriptions were available and there was no download required.

Usage Instructions: The person collecting the data reads aloud the last 3 digits of a serial number found on a tag that is attached to every crop, then says the key word "is", and then the weight of the crop. For example, if the serial code is 1234567 and the crop weights 2.4 pounds, then the user says "567 is 2.4 pounds" and ZipHarvest applies the weight to the associated serial number. The app is able to determine the correct serial code with only 3 digits because of a secondary filter on the type of crop.
